# 203.1130---Computer-organization-and-low-level-languages
 In this course, I learned about computer architecture using the LC-3 model. We programmed in LC-3 assembly to understand how high-level languages like C are translated. We also studied the LC-3's hardware implementation.

How to Run the Programs
Download and Install the LC-3 Simulator:

Ensure you have the LC-3 simulator installed on your computer. You can download it from here.
Load the Assembly Files:

Open the LC-3 simulator.
Load the .asm files into the simulator. You can do this by selecting File -> Open and navigating to the directory containing the .asm files.
